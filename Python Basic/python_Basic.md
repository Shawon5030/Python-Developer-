#### Lines 1-10: Variables and Data Types

```python
x = 10
y = 5.5
name = "Shawon"
is_active = True
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
PI = 3.1416
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
my_dict = {"name": "Shawon", "age": 22}
```

* **x = 10**: Assigns the integer 10 to the variable `x`.
* **y = 5.5**: Assigns the float 5.5 to the variable `y`.
* **name = "Shawon"**: A string value assigned to a variable.
* **is\_active = True**: A boolean value.
* **a, b, c = 1, 2, 3**: Assigns multiple variables at once.
* **PI = 3.1416**: Constants can be written in uppercase.
* **my\_list**: A mutable list that can store multiple values.
* **my\_tuple**: An immutable version of a list.
* **my\_set**: An unordered collection of unique elements.
* **my\_dict**: Key-value pair mapping, a dictionary.

These represent Python's most fundamental data types.
